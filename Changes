          Fall back to native pipes if POSIX pipes fail. Experimental, so will carp.

          Hard depends on perl 5.8.0 or greater due to >>&= File Open

          Fixed up the absense of parentheses in synopsis and tests.

          Tidied Synopsis Code.

          run_fused( $fh, 'Command String | bar' ) will now be interpreted as
          if to look for a literal program sharing that literal name. To get the prior behaviour,
          pass a scalar ref instead, ie: run_fused( $fh, \'Command String' ).

          run_fused( $fh, @list ) now properly calls exec with
            exec { $program } @args

          dropped Time::HiRes and now use a stupid arthimetic loop to delay things.
