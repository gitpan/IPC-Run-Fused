1.000000 2014-10-03T05:04:57Z
 [00 - Important - Version Scheme Change]
 - Using 1.xxxyyy ( mantissa=6 ) instead of 0.xxxyyyzz
 - This may affect hand-operated downstreams
 - This is the primary reason for the 1.x on the box.

 [01 - Important - Toolkit Switch]
 - Tooling now uses ExtUtils::MakeMaker
 - This may affect hand-operated downstreams
 - "Latest" Testing dependencies now merely recommendations.

 [Packaging]
 - Smarter Handling of Win32 Prereqs

0.04000100 2013-02-05T07:17:18Z
 [BugFix]
 - load IO::Handle in the test script.

0.04000000 2013-02-05T05:14:00Z
 [!Features]
 - Should now actually work on Win32 due to the discovery of Win32::Job
 - Fail behaviour should be more concise with additional context.

 [BugFix]
 - previous release accidentally dropped _fail method.

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 0.03000000, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - runtime: +2 ↑1 (suggests: +2)

 [Internals]
 - _fail method now unified via goto \&IPC::Run::Fused::_fail
 - new ::Win32 namespace to implement Win32 Features

 [Tests]
 - reworked to not be order dependent, only flush-atomic.
 - previously disabled tests re-enabled on Win32

0.03000000 2013-02-03T00:47:09Z
 [!Features]
 - Most the code for Unix-like environments moved to ::POSIX with a proxy method in the main namespace that will defer
   to the right backend depending on the value of $^O.
 - This serves as a stepping stone to working Win32 Support.
 - Win32 Currently causes a die() because its broken anyway atm.
 - Added support for passing a coderef to run.
 - IO::Pipe code dropped and just uses a plain `pipe` which is less magical.

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 0.02000000, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - runtime: ↓1 -2

 [Modules::New]
 - IPC::Run::Fused::POSIX

 [Tests::New]
 - t/03-captures-nodelay-fork.t

0.02000000 2013-01-26T01:07:56Z
 - Guts removed mostly and replaced with IO::Pipe, because the existing code was broken and not very portable.

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 0.01028807, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - runtime: +1

0.01028807 2013-01-26T00:26:12Z
 - Maint release.

 [BugFixes]
 - disabled tests on Win32. We have had it work on win32, but the tests are broken on win32, and we're not quite sure
   why yet. Code is planned to have a total overhaul at some point.

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 0.01028806, see misc/*.deps* for details

0.01028806 2010-07-30T05:52:27Z
 - Migrate code to [@KENTNL]
 - Fix non-portable vstring in use $version;

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 0.01001607, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - build: +1
 - configure: +1
 - runtime: +1 -2
 - test: +4

0.01001607 2009-11-06T06:34:07Z
 - Native pipes by default.
 - Removed needless POSIX::dup();
 - Loads more error handling to try work out whats going wrong in tests.
 - Reorgansied fork() code into a handy subroutine.
 - Reduced Test-grinding from 400 to 100, as 100 seems enough to make problems turn up if there are any

0.01001122 2009-11-01T21:22:16Z
 - Fall back to native pipes if POSIX pipes fail. Experimental, so will carp.

0.01000514 2009-10-26T13:46:20Z
 - Hard depends on perl 5.8.0 or greater due to >>&= File Open
 - Fixed up the absense of parentheses in synopsis and tests.
 - Tidied Synopsis Code.
 - run_fused( $fh, 'Command String | bar' ) will now be interpreted as
 - if to look for a literal program sharing that literal name. To get the prior behaviour,
 - pass a scalar ref instead, ie: run_fused( $fh, \'Command String' ).
 - run_fused( $fh, @list ) now properly calls exec with exec { $program } @args
 - dropped Time::HiRes and now use a stupid arthimetic loop to delay things.

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 0.01000001, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - runtime: -1

0.01000001 2009-10-21T00:36:09Z
