Revision history for IPC-Run-Fused

0.03000000 2013-02-03T00:47:09Z
 [!Features]
 - Most the code for Unix-like environments moved to ::POSIX with a proxy
   method in the main namespace that will defer to the right backend
   depending on the value of $^O.
 - This serves as a stepping stone to working Win32 Support.
 - Win32 Currently causes a die() because its broken anyway atm.
 - Added support for passing a coderef to run.
 - IO::Pipe code dropped and just uses a plain `pipe` which is less
   magical.

 [Dependencies::Changed / runtime_requires]

0.02000000 2013-01-26T01:07:56Z
 - Guts removed mostly and replaced with IO::Pipe, because the existing
   code was broken and not very portable.

 - IO::Pipe

0.01028807 2013-01-26T00:26:12Z
 - Maint release.

 [BugFixes]
 - disabled tests on Win32. We have had it work on win32, but the tests are
   broken on win32, and we're  not quite sure why yet. Code is planned to
   have a total overhaul at some point.

0.01028806 2010-07-30T05:52:27Z
 - Migrate code to [@KENTNL]
 - Fix non-portable vstring in use $version;

0.01001607 2009-11-06T06:34:07Z
 - Native pipes by default.
 - Removed needless POSIX::dup();
 - Loads more error handling to try work out whats going wrong in tests.
 - Reorgansied fork() code into a handy subroutine.
 - Reduced Test-grinding from 400 to 100, as 100 seems enough to make
   problems  turn up if there are any

0.01001122 2009-11-01T21:22:16Z
 - Fall back to native pipes if POSIX pipes fail. Experimental, so will
   carp.

0.01000514 2009-10-26T13:46:20Z
 - Hard depends on perl 5.8.0 or greater due to >>&= File Open
 - Fixed up the absense of parentheses in synopsis and tests.
 - Tidied Synopsis Code.
 - run_fused( $fh, 'Command String | bar' ) will now be interpreted as
 - if to look for a literal program sharing that literal name. To get the
   prior behaviour,
 - pass a scalar ref instead, ie: run_fused( $fh, \'Command String' ).
 - run_fused( $fh, @list ) now properly calls exec with exec { $program }
   @args
 - dropped Time::HiRes and now use a stupid arthimetic loop to delay
   things.

0.01000001 2009-10-21T00:36:09Z
 - First version.
